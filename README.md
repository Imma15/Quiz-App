# Quiz-App

I have created the educational app as part of the Google Android Basics Challenge. It contains 10 questions for one of the subjects taught in Kenyan schools  -Christian Religious Education.
It is a fun way to have students check their level of knowledge in the subject area.

The features include multiple select questions (radio view groups, textViews, Toast method, etc) as required from the rubric.

Have fun testing the features!
